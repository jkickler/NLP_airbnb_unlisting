## 1. Objective
The goal of this project is to use NLP models to predict whether a property listed on Airbnb will be unlisted in the next quarter 1.

All steps including Exploration, Preprocessing, Feature Engineering and Modelling are in detail explained in the notebook.

## 2. Running the code
Before running the code, please install the needed libraries. Next to Pytorch and Hugging Face, several NLP libraries like NLTK and Spacy were used.
